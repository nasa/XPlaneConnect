 * Terrain Y-Testing
 ***************************************************************************/
/*
 * The Y-testing API allows you to locate the physical scenery mesh. This
 * would be used to place dynamic graphics on top of the ground in a plausible
 * way or do physics interactions.
 * 
 * The Y-test API works via probe objects, which are allocated by your plugin
 * and used to query terrain. Probe objects exist both to capture which
 * algorithm you have requested (see probe types) and also to cache query
 * information.
 * 
 * Performance Guidelines
 * ----------------------
 * 
 * It is generally faster to use the same probe for nearby points and
 * different probes for different points. Try not to allocate more than
 * "hundreds" of probes at most. Share probes if you need more. Generally,
 * probing operations are expensive, and should be avoided via caching when
 * possible.
 * 
 * Y testing returns a location on the terrain, a normal vector, and a
 * velocity vector. The normal vector tells you the slope of the terrain at
 * that point. The velocity vector tells you if that terrain is moving (and is
 * in meters/second). For example, if your Y test hits the aircraft carrier
 * deck, this tells you the velocity of that point on the deck.
 * 
 * Note: the Y-testing API is limited to probing the loaded scenery area,
 * which is approximately 300x300 km in X-Plane 9. Probes outside this area
 * will return the height of a 0 MSL sphere.
 *
