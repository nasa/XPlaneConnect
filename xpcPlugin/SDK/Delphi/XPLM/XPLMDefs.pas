   This file is contains the cross-platform and basic definitions for the
   X-Plane SDK.
   
   The preprocessor macros APL, LIN and IBM must be defined to specify the
   compilation target; define APL to 1 to compile on Mac, IBM to 1 to compile
   on Windows and LIN to 1 to compile on Linux. Only one compilation target
   may be used at a time. You must specify these macro definitions before
   including XPLMDefs.h or any other XPLM headers.  You can do this using the
   -D command line option or a preprocessor header.

 * DLL Definitions

{
   These definitions control the importing and exporting of functions within
   the DLL.
   
   You can prefix your five required callbacks with the PLUGIN_API macro to
   declare them as exported C functions.  The XPLM_API macro identifies
   functions that are provided to you via the plugin SDK.  (Link against
   XPLM.lib to use these functions.)

    XPLMPluginID
    
    Each plug-in is identified by a unique integer ID.  This ID can be used to
    disable or enable a plug-in, or discover what plug-in is 'running' at the
    time.  A plug-in ID is unique within the currently running instance of
    X-Plane unless plug-ins are reloaded.  Plug-ins may receive a different
    unique ID each time they are loaded. This includes the unloading and
    reloading of plugins that are part of the user's aircraft.
    
    For persistent identification of plug-ins, use XPLMFindPluginBySignature in
    XPLMUtiltiies.h .
    
    -1 indicates no plug-in.

    XPLMKeyFlags
    
    These bitfields define modifier keys in a platform independent way. When a
    key is pressed, a series of messages are sent to your plugin.  The down
    flag is set in the first of these messages, and the up flag in the last. 
    While the key is held down, messages are sent with neither flag set to
    indicate that the key is being held down as a repeated character.
    
    The control flag is mapped to the control flag on Macintosh and PC. 
    Generally X-Plane uses the control key and not the command key on
    Macintosh, providing a consistent interface across platforms that does not
    necessarily match the Macintosh user interface guidelines.  There is not
    yet a way for plugins to access the Macintosh control keys without using
    #ifdefed code.

{___________________________________________________________________________
 * ASCII CONTROL KEY CODES
 ___________________________________________________________________________}
{
   These definitions define how various control keys are mapped to ASCII key
   codes. Not all key presses generate an ASCII value, so plugin code should
   be prepared to see null characters come from the keyboard...this usually
   represents a key stroke that has no equivalent ASCII, like a page-down
   press.  Use virtual key codes to find these key strokes.
   
   ASCII key codes take into account modifier keys; shift keys will affect
   capitals and punctuation; control key combinations may have no vaild ASCII
   and produce NULL.  To detect control-key combinations, use virtual key
   codes, not ASCII keys.

{___________________________________________________________________________
 * VIRTUAL KEY CODES
 ___________________________________________________________________________}
{
   These are cross-platform defines for every distinct keyboard press on the
   computer. Every physical key on the keyboard has a virtual key code.  So
   the "two" key on the top row of the main keyboard has a different code from
   the "two" key on the numeric key pad.  But the 'w' and 'W' character are
   indistinguishable by virtual key code because they are the same physical
   key (one with and one without the shift key).
   
   Use virtual key codes to detect keystrokes that do not have ASCII
   equivalents, allow the user to map the numeric keypad separately from the
   main keyboard, and detect control key and other modifier-key combinations
   that generate ASCII control key sequences (many of which are not available
   directly via character keys in the SDK).
   
   To assign virtual key codes we started with the Microsoft set but made some
   additions and changes.  A few differences:
   
   1. Modifier keys are not available as virtual key codes.  You cannot get
      distinct modifier press and release messages.  Please do not try to use
      modifier keys as regular keys; doing so will almost certainly interfere
      with users' abilities to use the native X-Plane key bindings.
   2. Some keys that do not exist on both Mac and PC keyboards are removed.
   3. Do not assume that the values of these keystrokes are interchangeable
      with MS v-keys.
