   ## THEORY OF OPERATION AND NOTES
   
   Widgets are persistent view 'objects' for X-Plane. A widget is an object
   referenced by its opaque handle (widget ID) and the APIs in this file. You
   cannot access the widget's guts directly. Every Widget has the following
   intrinsic data:
   
   - A bounding box defined in global screen coordinates with 0,0 in the
     bottom left and +y = up, +x = right.
   - A visible box, which is the intersection of the bounding box with the
     widget's parents visible box.
   - Zero or one parent widgets. (Always zero if the widget is a root widget.
   - Zero or more child widgets.
   - Whether the widget is a root. Root widgets are the top level plugin
     windows.
   - Whether the widget is visible.
   - A text string descriptor, whose meaning varies from widget to widget.
   - An arbitrary set of 32 bit integral properties defined by 32-bit integral
     keys. This is how specific widgets store specific data.
   - A list of widget callback procedures that implements the widgets
     behaviors.
   
   The Widgets library sends messages to widgets to request specific behaviors
   or notify the widget of things.
   
   Widgets may have more than one callback function, in which case messages
   are sent to the most recently added callback function until the message is
   handled. Messages may also be sent to parents or children; see the
   XPWidgetDefs.h header file for the different widget message dispatching
   functions. By adding a callback function to a window you can 'subclass' its
   behavior.
   
   A set of standard widgets are provided that serve common UI purposes. You
   can also customize or implement entirely custom widgets.
   
   Widgets are different than other view hierarchies (most notably Win32,
   which they bear a striking resemblance to) in the following ways:
   
   - Not all behavior can be patched. State that is managed by the XPWidgets
     DLL and not by individual widgets cannot be customized.
   - All coordinates are in global screen coordinates. Coordinates are not
     relative to an enclosing widget, nor are they relative to a display
     window.
   - Widget messages are always dispatched synchronously, and there is no
     concept of scheduling an update or a dirty region. Messages originate
     from X-Plane as the sim cycle goes by. Since X-Plane is constantly
     redrawing, so are widgets; there is no need to mark a part of a widget as
     'needing redrawing' because redrawing happens frequently whether the
     widget needs it or not.
   - Any widget may be a 'root' widget, causing it to be drawn; there is no
     relationship between widget class and rootness. Root widgets are
     implemented as XPLMDisplay windows.

 * WIDGET CREATION AND MANAGEMENT
 ___________________________________________________________________________}

   {
    XPCreateWidget
    
    This function creates a new widget and returns the new widget's ID to you.
    If the widget creation fails for some reason, it returns NULL. Widget
    creation will fail either if you pass a bad class ID or if there is not
    adequate memory.
    
    Input Parameters:
    
    - Top, left, bottom, and right in global screen coordinates defining the
      widget's location on the screen.
    - inVisible is 1 if the widget should be drawn, 0 to start the widget as
      hidden.
    - inDescriptor is a null terminated string that will become the widget's
      descriptor.
    - inIsRoot is 1 if this is going to be a root widget, 0 if it will not be.
    - inContainer is the ID of this widget's container. It must be 0 for a root
      widget. For a non-root widget, pass the widget ID of the widget to place
      this widget within. If this widget is not going to start inside another
      widget, pass 0; this new widget will be created but will not be drawn
      until it is placed inside another widget.
    - inClass is the class of the widget to draw. Use one of the predefined
      class-IDs to create a standard widget.
    
    A note on widget embedding: a widget is only called (and will be drawn,
    etc.) if it is placed within a widget that will be called. Root widgets are
    always called. So it is possible to have whole chains of widgets that are
    simply not called. You can preconstruct widget trees and then place them
    into root widgets later to activate them if you wish.

    This class destroys a widget. Pass in the ID of the widget to kill. If you
    pass 1 for inDestroyChilren, the widget's children will be destroyed first,
    then this widget will be destroyed. (Furthermore, the widget's children
    will be destroyed with the inDestroyChildren flag set to 1, so the
    destruction will recurse down the widget tree.) If you pass 0 for this
    flag, direct child widgets will simply end up with their parent set to 0.

    This sends any message to a widget. You should probably not go around
    simulating the predefined messages that the widgets library defines for
    you. You may however define custom messages for your widgets and send them
    with this method.
    
    This method supports several dispatching patterns; see XPDispatchMode for
    more info. The function returns 1 if the message was handled, 0 if it was
    not.
    
    For each widget that receives the message (see the dispatching modes), each
    widget function from the most recently installed to the oldest one receives
    the message in order until it is handled.

    This function changes which container a widget resides in. You may NOT use
    this function on a root widget! inSubWidget is the widget that will be
    moved. Pass a widget ID in inContainer to make inSubWidget be a child of
    inContainer. It will become the last/closest widget in the container. Pass
    0 to remove the widget from any container. Any call to this other than
    passing the widget ID of the old parent of the affected widget will cause
    the widget to be removed from its old parent. Placing a widget within its
    own parent simply makes it the last widget.
    
    NOTE: this routine does not reposition the sub widget in global
    coordinates. If the container has layout management code, it will
    reposition the subwidget for you, otherwise you must do it with
    SetWidgetGeometry.

    This routine returns the value of a widget's property, or 0 if the property
    is not defined. If you need to know whether the property is defined, pass a
    pointer to an int for inExists; the existence of that property will be
    returned in the int. Pass NULL for inExists if you do not need this
    information.

   {
    XPSetKeyboardFocus
    
    Controls which widget will receive keystrokes. Pass the widget ID of the
    widget to get the keys. Note that if the widget does not care about
    keystrokes, they will go to the parent widget, and if no widget cares about
    them, they go to X-Plane.
    
    If you set the keyboard focus to widget ID 0, X-Plane gets keyboard focus.
    
    This routine returns the widget ID that ended up with keyboard focus, or 0
    for X-Plane.
    
    Keyboard focus is not changed if the new widget will not accept it. For
    setting to X-Plane, keyboard focus is always accepted.

                                        inWidget            : XPWidgetID) : XPWidgetID;
    cdecl; external XPWIDGETS.DLL;

   {
    XPLoseKeyboardFocus
    
    This causes the specified widget to lose focus; focus is passed to its
    parent, or the next parent that will accept it. This routine does nothing
    if this widget does not have focus.

    This routine returns the widget that has keyboard focus, or 0 if X-Plane
    has keyboard focus or some other plugin window that does not have widgets
    has focus.

 * CREATING CUSTOM WIDGETS
 ___________________________________________________________________________}

   {
    XPAddWidgetCallback
    
    This function adds a new widget callback to a widget. This widget callback
    supercedes any existing ones and will receive messages first; if it does
    not handle messages they will go on to be handled by pre-existing widgets.
    
    The widget function will remain on the widget for the life of the widget.
    The creation message will be sent to the new callback immediately with the
    widget ID, and the destruction message will be sent before the other widget
    function receives a destruction message.
    
    This provides a way to 'subclass' an existing widget. By providing a second
    hook that only handles certain widget messages, you can customize or extend
    widget behavior.
   }
   PROCEDURE XPAddWidgetCallback(
                                        inWidget            : XPWidgetID;

   {
    XPGetWidgetClassFunc
    
    Given a widget class, this function returns the callbacks that power that
    widget class.
