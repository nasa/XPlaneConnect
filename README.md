#X-Plane Connect
The X-Plane Connect (XPC) Toolbox is an open source research tool used to
interact with the commercial flight simulator software X-Plane. XPC allows users
to control aircraft and receive state information from aircraft simulated in
X-Plane using functions written in C, C++, Java, or MATLAB in real time over the
network. This research tool has been used to visualize flight paths, test control
algorithms, simulate an active airspace, or generate out-the-window visuals for
in-house flight simulation software. Possible applications include active control
of an XPlane simulation, flight visualization, recording states during a flight,
or interacting with a mission over UDP.

###Migrating to 1.0
For existing users, several important breaking changes have been made in version
1.0. For detailed information, see the 1.0 release changelog. For client-specific
guidlines on migrating to 1.0, refer to the follwing guides:

####[C](https://github.com/nasa/XPlaneConnect/wiki/Migrating-to-1.0-C)

####[MATLAB](https://github.com/nasa/XPlaneConnect/wiki/Migrating-to-1.0-MATLAB)

####[Java](https://github.com/nasa/XPlaneConnect/wiki/Migrating-to-1.0-Java)

###Architecture
XPC includes an X-Plane plugin (xpcPlugin) and clients written in several
languages that interact with the plugin.

####Quick Start
To get started using X-Plane Connect, do the following.

1. Purchase and install X-Plane 9 or 10.
2. Copy the X-Plane Plugin folder (xpcPlugin/XPlaneConnect) to the plugin
directory ([X-Plane Directory]/Resources/plugins/)
3. Write some code using one of the clients to manipulate X-Plane data.

Each client is located in a top-level directory of the repository named for the
client's language. The client directories generally include a 'src' folder
containing the client source code, and an 'Examples' folder containing sample
code demonstrating how to use the client.

####Additional Information
For detailed information about XPC and how to use the XPC clients, refer to the
[XPC Wiki](https://github.com/nasa/XPlaneConnect/wiki).

####Capabilities
The XPC Toolbox allows the user to manipulate the internal state of X-Plane by
reading and setting DataRefs, a complete list of which can be found on the
[X-Plane SDK wiki](http://www.xsquawkbox.net/xpsdk/docs/DataRefs.html).

In addition, several convenience functions are provided, which allow the user to
efficiently execute common commands. These functions include the ability to set
the position and control surfaces of both player and multiplayer aircraft. In
addition, the pause function allows users to easily pause and un-pause X-Plane's
physics simulation engine.

###Compatibility
XPC has been tested with the following software versions:
* Windows: Vista, 7, & 8
* Mac OSX: 10.8-10.10
* Linux: Tested on Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation release 6.6
* X-Plane: 9 & 10

###Contributing
All contributions are welcome! If you are having problems with the plugin, please
open an issue on GitHub or email [Chris Teubert](mailto:christopher.a.teuber@nasa.gov).
If you would like to contribute directly, please feel free to open a pull request
against the "develop" branch. Pull requests will be evaluated and integrated into
the next official release.
