# X-Plane Connect
The X-Plane Connect (XPC) Toolbox is an open source research tool used to
interact with the commercial flight simulator software X-Plane. XPC allows users
to control aircraft and receive state information from aircraft simulated in
X-Plane using functions written in C, C++, Java, MATLAB, or Python in real time over the
network. This research tool has been used to visualize flight paths, test control
algorithms, simulate an active airspace, or generate out-the-window visuals for
in-house flight simulation software. Possible applications include active control
of an XPlane simulation, flight visualization, recording states during a flight,
or interacting with a mission over UDP.

### Architecture
XPC includes an X-Plane plugin (xpcPlugin) and clients written in several
languages that interact with the plugin.

#### Quick Start
To get started using X-Plane Connect, do the following.

1. Purchase and install X-Plane 9, 10 or 11.
2. Download the `XPlaneConnect.zip` file from the latest release on the [releases](https://github.com/nasa/XPlaneConnect/releases) page.
3. Copy the contents of the .zip archive to the plugin directory (`[X-Plane Directory]/Resources/plugins/`)
4. Write some code using one of the clients to manipulate X-Plane data.

Each client is located in a top-level directory of the repository named for the
client's language. The client directories generally include a `src` folder
containing the client source code, and an `Examples` folder containing sample
code demonstrating how to use the client.

#### Additional Information
For detailed information about XPC and how to use the XPC clients, refer to the
[XPC Wiki](https://github.com/nasa/XPlaneConnect/wiki).

#### Capabilities
The XPC Toolbox allows the user to manipulate the internal state of X-Plane by
reading and setting DataRefs, a complete list of which can be found on the
[X-Plane SDK wiki](http://www.xsquawkbox.net/xpsdk/docs/DataRefs.html).

In addition, several convenience functions are provided, which allow the user to
efficiently execute common commands. These functions include the ability to set
the position and control surfaces of both player and multiplayer aircraft. In
addition, the pause function allows users to easily pause and un-pause X-Plane's
physics simulation engine.

### Compatibility
XPC has been tested with the following software versions:
* Windows: Vista, 7, & 8
* Mac OSX: 10.8-10.14
* Linux: Tested on Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation release 6.6
* X-Plane: 9, 10 & 11

### Contributing
All contributions are welcome! If you are having problems with the plugin, please
open an issue on GitHub or email [Chris Teubert](mailto:christopher.a.teubert@nasa.gov).
If you would like to contribute directly, please feel free to open a pull request
against the "develop" branch. Pull requests will be evaluated and integrated into
the next official release.

      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
